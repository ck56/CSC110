Created the program, and it wasn't in line with the current design. Wrote the code to function with less of the objectives.
	- originally wanted to print a list of all yarns, however the desire was too out of scope for time constraints
	- design was structured in a way that wasn't flowing well

12/11

Design/Code was rewritten in order to flow better:
 	- Code was written first to see what worked and what didn't
	- Wanted to ask if users for a general project and use those general project numbers but that would start to get into arrays, etc. (scrapped)
	- definitions were laid put so we knew what the math would be while building the flow
	- Code would run, however it wouldn't overwrite - would only print the first results unless (Y) for Yarn Double. Was tested by multiple users and they had the same issue.

Determined that there was too many unnecessary while and if loops. Trimmed off the extra loops and rewrote the program. Small error with the else statement - fixed with indentation. 

Added spacing to code so it was visually easier to read.

Program worked without errors - tested it with other members of group.

Issue with def(projectCost) naming, edited to match. 

Unused variables/inputs put to use in print functions - changed wording in print statements to read and print easier later in code (yarnName)

Not sure if pattern yarnWeight is needed - took out and moved input question to yarn questions instead
	- helps visually keep track of what yarn and pattern characteristics there 
	- if information was being stored in a list, etc. then the variables would be more important
	- decided to add it back in

Found last minute issue with numbers rounding and not adding correctly due to math.ceil. Fixed by using currency and round values.
